# TypeScript-Code-Snippets
My Experiments with TypeScript
Here we will explore Design Patterns in TypeScript.
Currently I have implemented 3 patterns -
1. Builder Pattern - Used to build complex objects. Improves code readablity.
2. Abstract Factory - Used to dynamically create objects on runtime based on certain metadata.
3. Delegator Pattern. - Used to decouple code's logic.

Steps to run the examples -
1. Compile the TypeScript using `tsc -w -p <fileName.ts>`. It will generate corresponding js file.
2. run the js file usng node `node <filename.js>`.
